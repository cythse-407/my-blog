      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p><em>Posted on July 4, 2025</em></p>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm a self taught programmer, visual artist, musical composer and a young student who created this
        blog as a way to share my thoughts, ideas and projects with everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am always on the verge of trying new things, and learn from doing things. You won't find my real name here, or
        any specifics, but I hope you find something meaningful and inspirational in what I share. I like to try a lot of 
        things in my time, and I hope I can meaningfully portray my work and ideas with anyone reading this. I may not be
        regular with posts, but I will try to keep up. The webpage is, of course, still being worked on, and I hope I can
        turn it into something big. Any support would be greatly appreciated along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for being here. If you would like to contribute, help or post, feel free to contact me via any means 
        appropriate.
