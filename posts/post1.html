      <h2>How I Built This Blog</h2>
      <p><em>Posted on July 5, 2025</em></p>
      <p>
        This blog was created using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no backend. It's very simple and you can do it yourself
        too! Eventhough I have prior programming experience, I think it's easy enough for anyone to try. Making a webpage like 
        this one does not have to be a blog, it can be anything you want - a community platform, a streaming site, a webpage 
        with information about a business, the list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting into the specific bits, making a webpage requires you to have atleast an understanding of the following 
        languages: <br>
        - HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)<br>
        - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)<br>
        - JS (Javascript)<br>
        Another thing you might preferably need is an IDE - Intergrated Development Environment, or any text editor like Notepad
        can work as well. There are many options if you consider IDEs, and there is no correct option.<br>
        An IDE is a software or text editor that is used to create and edit code. Programmers tend to use an IDE as it provides
        a way to sort code, a way to identify, sort and read code, debug (find errors) in code and other availabilities.<br>
        All your webpage's source code (the files all the code is accessed and assembled from) is normally in a single file.
        You use HTML to make a layout of the website and add elements, such as text, buttons, images, links, and so on. CSS 
        is used to style these elements; assign colors, attributes, details, sizes, etc. Javascript (not to be confused with Java) 
        is used for scripting - giving functionality to buttons and icons, fetching data, making animations, etc. Spending time 
        to learn these languages is an investing worth it, but you do not need professional experience in them to start making 
        websites. You can use AI to write code in your initial stages before moving on to fully-fledged coding and learn the 
        languages from online websites and videos. With the internet at your disposal, there are absolutely no excuses!<br>
        You can check out the source code for this webpage on Github too!<br>
        On a further note, Javascript has similar syntax (writing style/format) as C/C++, so it is helpful if you already know
        C/C++ and other similar languages like C# and Java (once again, Java is NOT the same as Javascript!).

        The only difference between great men and small men is action. Turn ideas and dreams into reality. The sooner you start 
        doing this things you're looking forward to, the better it is. Sometimes starting is the hardest part, and you may not 
        know where to begin or be overwhelmed, and by putting down your first steps can you advance forward.<br>
